            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    After observing the choropleth of U.S. house prices, there is clearly a lot of variation. The goal of this project is to explore the underlying factors contributing to these differences and determine what drives house prices in various areas. For this study, I'll concentrate on the Northeast and West. First I'll introduce the new data used in this analysis, then conduct some exploratory data analyis to visualize some keys trends, last,y I'll apply multiple regression models to evaluate the impact of these variables in both regions.
                </p>
            <h2>Understanding House Price Influences</h2>
            <p>
                In the process of buying a home, understanding the factors that affect house prices is essential. While many variables contribute to pricing, establishing direct causation for any single factor is complex. To analyze this relationship effectively, I categorized the influencing elements into two main groups: house characteristics and demographics.<br><br>
                
                House characteristics will refer to the physical attributes of a property—such as size, number of beds/baths, and lot size—that can directly impact market value. Demographics, in contrast, will refer to socio-economic factors tied to the location, influencing quality of life for potential buyers. One might assume that house characteristics have a stronger impact on prices compared to demographics, however this research showed the opposite. My aim is to explore how well these factors can predict listing prices and draw insightful conclusions from the analysis.<br><br>

                To frame my analysis I'll pose the critical question:<br>
                    <li>
                        For the Western and Northeast regions, how do the number of beds, baths, lot acres, population density, unemployment rate, house size, city, state, and crime rate predict house prices?
                    </li>
            </p>
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>
                This investigation is crucial because purchasing a home is a big decision, requiring a clear understanding of what influences price. By dissecting these factors, I aim to provide valuable insights tailored to each region that the individual can utilize. Additionally, the findings from this analysis can serve urban planners and policymakers, aiding in the development of sustainable, attractive communities that address future residents' needs and preferences. Understanding the consumer preferences that shape demand and affect house prices is vital for informed planning and policy-making

            <h2>Data Collection & Preparation</h2>
            <p>
                The data combined housing listings from Realtor.com (April 2022 to March 2024) with demographic data from public U.S. sources, like city population, unemployment rates (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), and crime rates (FBI). After cleaning and filtering, the final dataset consisted of over 1 million listings. Key features used were:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price (thousands)</li>
                    <li>House Size (sq. feet)</li>
                    <li>Lot Size (acre)</li>
                    <li> Bedrooms, Bathrooms</li>
                    <li>Population Density</li>
                    <li>Unemployment Rate</li>
                </ul><br>
                For analysis, I split the data into four regions (West, Northeast, South, Midwest), but focused on the West and Northeast for this project.
