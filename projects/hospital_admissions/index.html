            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project delves into a comprehensive dataset that spans a decade of clinical care for diabetic patients across the U.S. hospitals.
                Each row represents a patient's hospital admission and each column describes a feature of their admission.
                The objective is to analyze patient readmission rates and identify factors that may influence these rates. In short, are there any
                factors surrounding readmission that hospitals should be aware of and/or can work to improve? By examining patient 
                demographics, hospital stay details, and treatment, this analysis seeks to uncover actionable insights for improving patient
                care and reducing readmissions.

            <h2>Scope and Goals</h2>
            <p>The dataset encompasses a wide range of features, including patient demographics, hospital admission details, diagnosis codes, and medication data. For this analysis, the focus is on understanding how factors such as patient age, primary diagnosis, length of hospital stay, and medication usage correlate with readmission rates. The goals are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explore the general characteristics of diabetic patients and their hospital visits:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Examine the distribution of patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) across different readmission categories.</li>
                        <li>Analyze patterns in hospital admissions, including frequency and length of stays.</li>
                        <li>Identify common primary diagnoses and their correlation with readmission rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Analyze the relationship between various factors and readmission rates to provide actionable insights:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assess how patient age and gender influence readmission rates.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the impact of primary diagnosis and its severity on the likelihood of readmission.</li>
                        <li>Investigate the effect of length of hospital stay and type of medication on readmission rates.</li>
                        <li>Identify key factors that may contribute to higher or lower readmission rates, and suggest strategies for intervention.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h2>Data Preparation and Methodology</h2>
            <p>Data preparation involved cleaning and transforming the dataset to focus on relevant features. Unnecessary fields were removed, and encoded diagnosis codes were translated for clarity. Diagnosis codes with fewer occurrences were categorized as "N/A" to maintain simplicity. Key tests and medications were analyzed to assess their impact on readmission rates.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Insights and Findings</h2>
            <p>The analysis revealed several important trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients who did not receive diabetes medication had lower readmission rates, potentially due to better overall health or less severe conditions.</li>
                <li>High readmission rates were observed for chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure, indicating a need for improved patient education and adherence to treatment plans.</li>
                <li>Mixed results were found regarding the impact of key diagnostic tests like A1C and max glucose serum on readmission rates, suggesting the need for a more nuanced approach to diabetes management.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The findings underscore the importance of proactive healthcare management, especially in educating patients about post-discharge care and ensuring proper medication adherence. The analysis provides a foundation for hospitals to enhance patient outcomes and reduce readmission rates through targeted interventions and continuous quality improvement efforts.</p>
