<meta name="description" content="Hi, I’m Mark! I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s in Information Science with dual minors in Statistics and Data Science at UNC Chapel Hill and graduating mid-2025. I have nearly two years experience as a certified pharmacy technician. While the role doesn’t involve data work, I’ve been building a foundation in data management and visualization, as well as problem solving, communication, and reporting results in my course work/free time. I’m passionate about leveraging my skills in Python, Excel, and Tableau to create practical dashboards and visualizations. I also enjoy chess, music, audiobooks, game development, and learning about AI applications. I hope you find some of my work interesting. View My LinkedIn Profile" />
